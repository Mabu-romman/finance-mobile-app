# finance-mobile-app

This Android Mobile Application was my Senior Seminar project in college. It allows users to input their income and expenses, then saves that data in a SQLite database.
Users can then view the data they have inputted and apply filters to get a better understanding of their income and spending habits. Data can also be deleted from the database by the user.
